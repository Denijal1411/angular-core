This project is about new things which I used. The first one is angular 9 frontend framework, where I can build front side application. The second one  is .net core 3.1, where I can build back side aplication. 
In this project I used API controler.

Backend project involved N-layer architecture, I used Business logic, DAL(Data access layer), and my web applicaiton.

However, I used  code first database approach, too.
